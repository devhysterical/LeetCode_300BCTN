# Algorithm Training on LeetCode

This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving algorithmic problem-solving skills through LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform that provides a vast collection of coding challenges that can help you prepare for technical interviews.

## Content

The code in this repository covers a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to:

- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
- Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dynamic Programming)
- Mathematics (Number Theory, Combinatorics)
- String Manipulation

Each solution file contains the problem statement, a detailed approach to the solution, and the implementation of the solution in code.

## Usage

Each problem is solved in a separate file. To run a solution, navigate to the file and run the code using the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the programming language used.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss a problem or a potential solution.
